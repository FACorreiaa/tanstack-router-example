Tanstack router example:

1. operations.sensors is the main /operatios/sensors
2. Table has the path where we click in Column sensor
3. operations.sensors.id is the component we want to open on the "right" side instead of the map when we click but right now opens a new route /operations/sensors/id in a new page
